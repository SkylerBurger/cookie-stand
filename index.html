            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Thank you for stopping by Pat's Salmon Cookies' website. Here at PSC we pride ourselves on creating the most eclectic PNW baked goods for die-hard Cascadians. Why settle for a boring sweet treat when you can flavor it with smoked meat?</p>
            <p>Ever since Pat was a child, they admired their grandmother's incredible skill in the kitchen. Grammy Pat would work tirlessly night and day baking sweet confections for friends, family, and community members. Even though every treat was baked with Grammy's love, Pat couldn't ignore the feeling that something was misssing. After almost 30 years of experimentation in the kitchen, Pat has finally discovered the missing ingredient. SMOKED SALMON MEAT!</p>
            <p>Now you can safely enjoy the benefit of Pat's decades of trial and error. You really don't want to try past iterations like the gamey squirrel cookies or the chewie salamander cookies, trust us. Salmon is the perfect addition to traditional cookies, delivering a boost of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and smokey realness. We love these cookies and we're sure you will too!</p>
